   - ✝️ **Cross**: Plus-shaped strategic layout
   - 💎 **Diamond**: Diamond-shaped tactical field
   - 🏰 **Fortress**: Castle walls with corner bastions
3. **Join Room**: Enter a friend's room code to join their chosen battlefield
4. **Wait for Connection**: Both players must be connected to start

### 2. Ship Placement Phase
Both players simultaneously place 5 ships on their boards:
- Carrier (5 spaces)
- Battleship (4 spaces)
- Cruiser (3 spaces)
- Submarine (3 spaces)
- Destroyer (2 spaces)

**Placement Options**:
- **Manual**: Click ship → rotate if needed → click board to place
- **Random**: Use "Random Placement" for instant positioning
- **Ready**: Click "Ready to Battle" when all ships are placed

### 3. Battle Phase
- Players take turns attacking opponent's board
- 💥 = Hit (red) - Get another turn!
- 💧 = Miss (gray) - Turn switches to opponent
- First player to sink all opponent ships wins!
- **Strategic Note**: Each layout offers unique tactical challenges - some layouts have blocked areas that change ship placement strategies!

## Game Rules 📋

- Variable grid sizes depending on chosen layout (10x10 to 12x8)
- 5 ships of different sizes must be placed (Carrier-5, Battleship-4, Cruiser-3, Submarine-3, Destroyer-2)
- Ships cannot overlap or touch diagonally/adjacently
- Ships cannot be placed on blocked/invalid cells (shown with ⛔)
- Players alternate turns shooting at opponent's board
- Hit = Get another turn, Miss = Turn switches
- Game ends when all ships of one player are destroyed
- Real-time synchronization of all actions

## Map Layouts Strategy 🗺️

Each battlefield layout offers unique strategic advantages:

- **🏛️ Classic**: Balanced gameplay, perfect for beginners
- **📐 Rectangle**: More horizontal space favors larger ships
- **💍 Ring**: Forces ships to outer edges, creating chokepoints
- **✝️ Cross**: Central corridor creates high-traffic attack zones
- **💎 Diamond**: Tight space requires creative ship placement
- **🏰 Fortress**: Corner bastions and walls create defensive positions

**Host Advantage**: The room creator chooses the battlefield layout, giving them first knowledge of the terrain for strategic planning!
